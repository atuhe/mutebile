                <p>The Makerere University Private sector Forum MUPSF was established in April 2006 by Makerere University council after endorsement by the university senate to address longstanding challenges like Uganda’s youth unemployment, lack of private sector growth in Uganda and employment challenges. Its mission is to bridge the divide between the university and the public and private sector in order to see the social-economic development of Uganda. The vice chancellor then Prof. Livingstone S.Luboobi, PHD appointed a working committee composed of members from the private sector and public sectors as well as Makerere University to draw up opportunities for collaboration and mobilization, as well as to set the Forum’s agenda. In 2008, the Forum was officially incorporated as a company with full autonomy in policy making and governance. MUPSF also identified areas of collaboration with 15 public and private sector partners such as the Uganda Manufacturers Association and shell Uganda.</p>
                <p>In October 2015 the Makerere University Private sector Forum unveiled plans to build the Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile Centre of Excellence (TMCE). The Mutebile Centre, which will be allocated AT Makerere University, honors Dr. Mutebile, Governor of the Bank of Uganda and a longstanding champion of private sector development in Uganda. </p>
                <p>The Makerere University Private Sector Forum partnered with the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business in December 2016 to develop the 3 year strategic plan for the Mutebile Centre of Excellence. This further conveys our sense of mission and vision to build a strong and vibrant partnership between the academia and public-private sectors for national socio-economic development. By bridging the industry-university divide and establish itself as world-class Centre of Excellence.</p>
                <p>The vision of the Mutebile Centre of Excellence is to enable all students in Uganda to thrive in their careers through practical hands-on experience, entrepreneurial leadership, and mindset change. Through close partnership with the private sector, Mutebile Centre will also provide relevant research, business skills training, and customized consulting services to solve the challenges that startups and established companies grapple with in their journey to becoming viable and profitable businesses. Thanks to the visionary leadership of the Makerere University private sector Forum, the Centre is well positioned to officially launch.</p>
                <p>The University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business is honored to have supported Makerere University and the launch of the Mutebile Centre.  </p>
